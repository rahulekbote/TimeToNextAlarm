- **Material You Theming**: The widget adapts its colors dynamically to follow the Material You design theme on your device, ensuring a cohesive and personalized aesthetic.
- **Tap to Update**: A simple tap on the widget refreshes the time left until the next alarm and updates the theme to reflect any changes in your system's color scheme.

## 1x1 Widget

The 1x1 widget is designed to be simple and to the point, displaying only the hours and minutes left until the next alarm in a format like "Alarm: 05h 37m".
